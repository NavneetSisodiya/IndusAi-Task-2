# Drum Kit Web Application
The Drum Kit Web Application is an interactive webpage that allows users to play drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Each key is mapped to a different drum sound, simulating a real drum kit experience through your web browser. This project demonstrates how to integrate sound with key events in JavaScript, as well as how to create a visually appealing, responsive interface using HTML and CSS.
